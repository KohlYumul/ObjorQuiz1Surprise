        <p class="lead">
            Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a keen interest in building robust and scalable applications.
            My journey in web development started with a curiosity for how websites work, which quickly evolved into a
            dedication to mastering various technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in Django for backend development, leveraging its "batteries-included" philosophy to create
            efficient and secure web services. On the frontend, I enjoy crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces
            using modern HTML, CSS (with frameworks like Bootstrap), and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to create impactful digital experiences that are not only functional but also intuitive and visually appealing.
            I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills to tackle complex challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Feel free to connect with me on professional networks or explore my projects on this portfolio.

            <p>
                My vision is to contribute to innovative projects that solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.
                I believe in continuous learning and the power of collaboration to achieve great things.
